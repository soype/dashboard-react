# Dashboard React

A modified version of the dashboard created by [ZAINKEEPSCODE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7vHoUwClaM)

I copied the original dashboard to branch "dashboard_0.1", where you can see the changes I was set out to make.

The list of changes:

Added Dark Theme and Dark Theme selector
Fixed top margin of titles
Centered the Updates section on mobile
Fixed margins of items for mobile


To run:

Download latest release or git clone the branch you desire (I recommend for now to checkout the [modified branch](https://github.com/soype/dashboard-react/tree/modified_dashboard))

cd into the release

```
npm install
npm start
```

### Libraries used:

React-unicons
apexcharts
motion-framer
